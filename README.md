## Customer Churn Prediction

In this classification project, we aimed to predict whether a customer is likely to churn from a telecom company based on various features such as customer demographics, call usage, and account information. We started by exploring and visualizing the data to gain insights into the distribution and relationship between features. We then preprocessed the data by encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and splitting the data into training and test sets.

Next, we experimented with various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, to find the best-performing model. We optimized hyperparameters of the Gradient Boosting model using a grid search method and achieved a best accuracy score of 0.527 on the test set.

Some key insights from the project include the fact that call usage patterns, account information, and demographics can play a significant role in predicting customer churn. Additionally, we found that the Gradient Boosting algorithm outperformed other algorithms in this project.

However, we faced some challenges during the project, including dealing with imbalanced classes and optimizing hyperparameters of the models. To overcome these challenges, we used techniques such as oversampling and grid search.

Moving forward, the best ML components should be exported as a file to be loaded in an app that can help the telecom company to identify customers who are likely to churn and take proactive steps to retain them. Overall, this project demonstrates the importance of data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and hyperparameter optimization in achieving accurate predictions in a classification problem.
